üéÆ Elemental Duel Game: Where Code Meets Strategy!

Excited to share my latest Java project: Elemental Duel Game! üöÄ

Gameplay:
In Elemental Duel, two players compete to pick the highest elements from a row. Players take turns choosing from the ends, and scores are calculated in real-time. The game not only entertains but also challenges players' strategic thinking.

Why It's Important:

Java Mastery: Developed entirely in Java, this project showcases my coding skills, including loops, conditionals, and multithreading.
Problem-Solving: Designing the game logic tested my problem-solving abilities, ensuring efficient element selection and scoring.
User Experience: The colorful interface enhances user engagement, emphasizing my focus on creating enjoyable experiences.
Features:

Interactive: Players can customize the game by inputting the number of elements, making it accessible and user-friendly.
Real-Time Updates: Multithreading is used to display dynamic, real-time score calculations, adding excitement to the gameplay.
Visual Appeal: The vibrant terminal interface demonstrates my creativity in combining functionality with aesthetics.
